# op-cached: `op read` with a macOS Keychain cache.
#
# Why this exists: 1Password CLI ties its authorization to a terminal session
# (an ID based on the tty + start time). The authorization lasts 10 minutes of
# inactivity with a 12-hour hard cap, and NONE of that is configurable
# (https://developer.1password.com/docs/cli/app-integration-security/).
# Agent and script `op read` calls have no stable tty, so every read looks
# like a brand-new session and re-prompts Touch ID. This wrapper caches the
# secret in the macOS login Keychain (encrypted at rest, never a plaintext
# file) so one Touch ID unlock covers a whole work session.
#
# Usage:
#   op-cached <op://vault/item/field>     print secret (cache-first)
#   op-cached --refresh <op://ref>        force re-read from 1Password (rotation)
#   op-cached --clear                     purge ALL cached secrets
#
# TTL: OP_CACHE_TTL seconds, default 28800 (8h).
#
# Security model: the cache entry is readable by any process running as this
# user via the `security` CLI while the login Keychain is unlocked. That is a
# deliberate trade against authorization fatigue; scope is limited to the few
# cached fields, bounded by TTL, and wiped with --clear.
